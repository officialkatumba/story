So overflowing before meeting you
Just keep a secret
I pretend to be normal when I’m with you
I’m tired of looking for it
The place to return to for me is something made

On that day we exchanged
Things that are thicker than blood
A unified heart contract

Let’s go home holding hands
What are we going to eat today?
“Something like this happened”
I want to talk about it with you
On any day
Everything is comedy with you
On a bed that dances with a squeak
Still laughing out loud
The life full of fun continues

I grew up with low self-esteem
With this crazy star
I realized I was pretending to be normal
Who decided that?
My light can only be found in this place
